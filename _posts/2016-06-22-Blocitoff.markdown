description: Blocitoff is a self-destructing To-Do list that was built using Ruby on Rails. The idea behind it was that tasks not completed within a reasonable time shouldn't be on your To-Do list in the first place. The application requires a user to sign up/login and from there they can add new tasks and check completed tasks as 'done'. This project was part of the Bloc back end web development curriculum and was built utilizing user stories and wireframes. The main focus of the project was backend techniques so a very simple bootstrap styling was used.

description: For the second front end project with Bloc, I built three Alexa skills for use with their voice-controlled devices.  The first two were built using Amazon's trivia and fact skills templates.  The third skill was a custom one using nodeJS, AWS lambda and S3 cloud storage. Human Body Quiz, Soccer Facts and Nocturnal Ninja skills are currently available on Amazon's Alexa skills application(alexa.amazon.com).

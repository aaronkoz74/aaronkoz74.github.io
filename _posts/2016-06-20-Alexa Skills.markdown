description: For the second front end project with Bloc, I built three Alexa skills for use with their voice-controlled devices.  The first two were built using Amazon's trivia and fact skills templates.  The third skill was custom built using nodeJS, AWS lambda and S3 cloud storage. Human Body Quiz, Soccer Facts and Nocturnal Ninja skills are currently available on Amazon's <a href="http://alexa.amazon.com">Alexa</a> skills application.
